# Ionic starter build broken

An example repository which shows that repos generated by `ionic start ...` can't run `ng build` successfully

## Repo generation command

ionic start --type=angular --capacitor angularCapDemo blank

## Angular Build Error fix

I searched a bit more and found out that this seems to be an angular cli problem instead of an ionc starters one.

One guy from this issue angular/angular-cli#17262
had a helping comment:

Try to install "@babel/compat-data": "~7.8.0" to devDependencies. This is the only workaround which helped me.

I can confirm, that this removes the problem for me.
